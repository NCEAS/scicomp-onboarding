# scicomp-onboarding
This repo is for onboarding material for new team members (currently a work-in-progress)

Listed below is a mix of papers and tutorials about concepts we are trying to promote to the researchers we support and tools and workflows we used in our team.  You will find below a set of papers that we ask every new team member to read.  The goal is to give context about open and reproducible science NCEAS is promoting in the scientific community.  Also included is information on getting access to the tools you will need and some general information about working at NCEAS.

### Introductory Reading Materials

#### Papers

The goal of these reading materials is to give context about open and reproducible science NCEAS is promoting in the scientific community.

* Hampton et al 2015. ["The Tao of open science for ecology"](https://doi.org/10.1890/ES14-00402.1)

* Borer et al 2009. ["Effective Data Management"](https://doi.org/10.1890/0012-9623-90.2.205)

* Fegraus et al 2005. ["Maximizing the Value of Ecological Data with Structured Metadata:"](https://doi.org/10.1890/0012-9623(2005)86[158:MTVOED]2.0.CO;2)

* Heidborn 2008. ["Shedding Light on the Dark Data in the Long Tail of Science"](http://doi.org/10.1353/lib.0.0036)

#### Background information

For good background information on the tools that we use, read through the following chapters from a training we did for SNAPP postdoc earlier in the year: https://science-for-nature-and-people.github.io/2020-data-collab-workshop/2020-02-snapp/index.html

Chapters 3, 5, 8 will be a good background about the tools we use.

Chapters 9, 10 are a good data modeling introduction.

#### R Assessment

Finally, please complete this [R Training Assessment](https://cosima.nceas.ucsb.edu/r-self-assessment/) to self-assess your skills in R.

##### b. Get added to the SNAPP GitHub account

Register (if you have not already) for a personal GitHub account and send your username to Julien to be added to the [SNAPP GitHub](https://github.com/Science-for-Nature-and-People).  This GitHub has the repos that you will be directly working with.

##### c. Complete the NCEAS GitHub tutorial [here](https://nceas.github.io/training-git-intro/getting-started-with-git-rstudio.html)

This tutorial will help you with getting starting with git and GitHub using RStudio
